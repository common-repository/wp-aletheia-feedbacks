If you're a Web Developer or a Designer, Feedbacks allows you to gather feedback from your clients sites easily and get all in your own WordPress.

== Description ==

If you're a Web Developer or a Designer, Feedback allows you to gather feedback from your clients sites easily and get all in your own WordPress.

Your clients will be able to add comments, requests and bug reports from every and each page of their WordPress sites, even in the Admin! And you can receive all that information in your own WordPress implementation via XML-RPC

In your Feedbacks page, you can see from which site and what user created a request / comment for you.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Feedback->Settings to configure.

If you want to use the remote posting functionality, you need this plugin installed on both sites.
Also, we recommend creating a user in the remote WordPress for each site, so you can track things better. It can have any role, even "Subscriber".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

While we finish cooking http://wp-aletheia.org, you can send any request, question or bug report to support@wp-aletheia.org

Please, we would love to hear what you have to say and adapt this product to popular demand.
